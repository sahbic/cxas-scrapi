## What is CXAS SCRAPI?

Building conversational agents on Google CX Agent Studio is powerful — but the platform's raw API can feel low-level when you want to do something practical, like running a full suite of evaluations, linting your agent configs before a release, or wiring your agent into a CI/CD pipeline. That's exactly what CXAS SCRAPI is for.

CXAS SCRAPI is a high-level Python library and CLI that wraps the official `google-cloud-ces` client. It gives you friendly Python classes for every CX Agent Studio resource — Apps, Agents, Tools, Guardrails, Sessions, Evaluations, and more — plus a `cxas` command-line tool that lets you pull and push agent configs, run evaluations, and lint your agents against 60+ best-practice rules. Whether you're working in a Jupyter notebook, writing a Python script, or wiring things together in a GitHub Actions workflow, SCRAPI fits naturally into your workflow.

## What can you do with it?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :fontawesome-brands-python: **Python API**

    ---

    Pythonic classes for every CX Agent Studio resource. Create, read, update, and delete Apps, Agents, Tools, Guardrails, Sessions, Variables, Versions, and more — all from clean, readable Python code.

    [API Reference →](api/index.md)

-   :material-console: **CLI**

    ---

    The `cxas` command-line tool brings your agent configs down to disk with `cxas pull`, validates them with `cxas lint`, and sends them back with `cxas push`. Everything you need to manage agents without touching the UI.

    [CLI Reference →](cli/index.md)

-   :material-test-tube: **Evaluations**

    ---

    Five evaluation types — Platform Goldens, Local Simulations, Tool Tests, Callback Tests, and Turn Evals — let you validate your agent's behavior end-to-end, from individual tool calls to full multi-turn conversations.

    [Evaluation Guide →](guides/evaluation/index.md)

-   :material-check-decagram: **Linter**

    ---

    60+ lint rules check your agent configurations against established best practices before you push. Catch problems like missing tool descriptions, unsafe guardrail configurations, and structural issues early.

-   :material-robot: **AI Skills**

    ---

    The skills system brings AI-powered assistance directly into your development workflow. Skills can build, run, debug, and inspect your agents using the SCRAPI API as their backbone.

    [Skills Guide →](guides/skills/index.md)

-   :material-magnify: **Insights**

    ---

    Analyze conversation quality with CCAI Insights scorecards. Import, export, and manage scorecards programmatically or via the CLI.

-   :material-book-open-page-variant: **Design Guide**

    ---

    Battle-tested patterns for instruction design, agent architecture, tool design, error handling, and callbacks — distilled from production agents.

    [Design Guide →](design-guide/index.md)

-   :material-puzzle: **Patterns**

    ---

    Reusable architectural patterns for CXAS agents: the Slot Filling (Slot Machine) pattern, dynamic prompting, and self-healing error recovery.

    [Patterns →](patterns/index.md)

-   :material-school: **Tutorials**

    ---

    Build a complete restaurant reservation agent end-to-end. Covers slots, DAG orchestration, callbacks, evaluations, and iterative stabilization.
